# CodeClauseInternship_Object-Detection-System
  - I’ve developed a customized Object Detection System using YOLOv8, capable of identifying and categorizing objects in images of people and checking if they wear masks or not.

## Aim
  - Develop a system that can detect and classify objects in images or video streams.

## Description
  - Create an object detection model capable of identifying and locating multiple objects within an image or video. Utilize a pre-trained model such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN, and customize it to detect specific objects of interest.



I have also made Instance Segmentation Object Detection project
